A new [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) theme based on ~~semantic UI~~ Bootstrap. Inspired by the incredible [Casper theme for Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper).

# The idea

Based on Semantic UI, so I guess it should not be too ugly. This project is not intented to put any of well-designed element at all.
I probably will make use of many popular front-end technology, such as gulp, WebPack, TypeScript, SCSS, PostCSS. Of course I know nono of them so far, LOL.╮(￣▽￣")╭ 
But anyway, I am both ignorant and fearless.
Speaking of advantages......Em, None! Don't use it at all, it is definitely not worth your attention.

## About me

I am a newbie in frontend development, of course I can only produce trash. If you see stupid implementations(sure there are many of them), 
please don't beat me to death and spare me my life. Allow me to continue to contribute (crap) to Open-Source society.
